/**
 * This is a basic observable model that publishes a network available state, the state
 * is derived from device information, so we don't store anything persistently, see CounterModel
 * for a basic model that persists its state
 *
 * The purpose of this model is to maintain a network state so that this information can be
 * displayed on a UI.
 *
 * NB: don't use the state to decide whether you should attempt a network
 * call or not: ALWAYS attempt the call anyway and handle the failure if necessary
 *
 * Open the Structure pane on the left to get an overview of the public API for this model
